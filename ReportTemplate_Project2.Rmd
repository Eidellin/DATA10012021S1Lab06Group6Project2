Question 2 
What is the relationship between the amount of hours slept by an individual and their productivity?

Graph 2 
Do you think you get enough sleep vs how productive you think you are - the personâ€™s perception of their own productivity

```{r}
p6 = plot_ly(survey, x = ~`Do you believe you get enough sleep?`, color= ~`Do you consider yourself a productive person?`, type= 'box')
p6 <- p6 %>% layout(title="Do you believe you get enough sleep? vs Do you consider yourself a productive person?")
p6
```

Graph 3
	"Do you believe sleep has an effect on your productivity" vs R u productive person? 
	
```{r}
p6 = plot_ly(survey, x = ~`Do you believe sleep has an effect on your productivity`, y= ~`Do you consider yourself a productive person?`)

p6 <- p6 %>% layout(title="Do you believe sleep has an effect on your productivity vs Do you consider yourself a productive person?")
p6
```
	
Graph 4
	8 + vs Pro
	
```{r}
p6 = plot_ly(survey, x = ~`Does getting 8+ hours of sleep per night affect how productive you are?`, color= ~`Do you consider yourself a productive person?`, type= 'box')
p6 <- p6 %>% layout(title="Does getting 8+ hours of sleep per night affect how productive you are? vs Do you consider yourself a productive person?")
p6
>>>>>>> a299a38 (asdf)
```

G1

Hours vs enough sleeping?

```{r}
p6 = plot_ly(survey, x = ~`Do you believe you get enough sleep?`, color= ~sleeping_hours, type= 'box')
p6 <- p6 %>% layout(title="Do you believe you get enough sleep? vs sleeping hours?")
p6
```

hours vs consider produc?

```{r}
p6 = plot_ly(survey, x = ~sleeping_hours, color= ~`Do you consider yourself a productive person?`, type= 'box')
p6 <- p6 %>% layout(title="working time vs Do you consider yourself a productive person?")
p6
```

Hours vs 8+

```{r}
p6 = plot_ly(survey, x = ~`Does getting 8+ hours of sleep per night affect how productive you are?`, color= ~sleeping_hours, type= 'box')
p6 <- p6 %>% layout(title="Does getting 8+ hours of sleep per night affect how productive you are? vs sleeping hours?")
p6
```

working vs sleeping time

```{r}
p6 = plot_ly(survey, x = ~working_time, color= ~sleeping_hours, type= 'box')
p6 <- p6 %>% layout(title="working_time vs sleeping hours?")
p6
```

Hours vs believe sleep affect u 

```{r}
p6 = plot_ly(survey, x = ~`Do you believe sleep has an effect on your productivity`, color= ~sleeping_hours, type= 'box')
p6 <- p6 %>% layout(title="Do you believe sleep has an effect on your productivity vs sleeping hours?")
