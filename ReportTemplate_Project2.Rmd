## Research Questions 

age vs average hour to sleep
```{r}
# length of any variable is the number of people involved in the survey
n <- length(age)
for (i in 1:n) {
  if (sleeping_hours[i]=="3 or less") {
    sleeping_hours[i] <- 3
  } else if (sleeping_hours[i]=="10 or more") {
    sleeping_hours[i] <-10
  }
}
sleeping_hours <- unlist(sleeping_hours)
ls1 <- list()
for (i in unique(age)) {
  ls1[[i]] <- mean(sleeping_hours[age==i])
}
print(ls1)
a = unlist(ls1)
a
barplot(a)
